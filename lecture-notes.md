The McDonald’s Videogame by Molleindustria is a satirical simulation game that uses procedural rhetoric to critique the unethical practices of multinational corporations. Players manage the McDonald’s supply chain, including decisions about farming, factory production, advertising, and restaurant management. The game forces players to engage in exploitative practices, such as deforestation, corruption, and worker exploitation, to maintain profitability.

By embedding these mechanics into the gameplay, the game demonstrates how systemic corporate greed and unsustainable practices are incentivized within global capitalism. The procedural rhetoric lies in how the rules and outcomes of the game compel players to confront the moral compromises inherent in the pursuit of profit, effectively turning the system itself into the argument.

The McDonald’s Videogame operates along the principle of rules as arguments by using its game mechanics to expose and critique the exploitative practices necessary to sustain corporate profitability.

How Rules Make Arguments in McDonald’s Videogame
	1.	Rules Define Player Interactions:
	•	Players manage various interconnected systems: farming, production, marketing, and restaurant operations.
	•	To succeed, players must balance profit margins with resource management, customer satisfaction, and public perception.
	2.	Cause-and-Effect Relationships:
	•	If players avoid unethical practices (e.g., using growth hormones, deforesting land, or lobbying government officials), their profits plummet, and the game becomes nearly impossible to “win.”
	•	The game directly links unethical behavior with corporate success, arguing that these practices are incentivized within the system.
	3.	Reinforcement of Behaviors:
	•	Players are rewarded for adopting exploitative strategies, such as cutting corners in food quality, overworking employees, or bribing politicians to suppress negative publicity.
	•	This reinforces the idea that the system itself is inherently flawed, as profitability depends on unsustainable and unethical decisions.

Argument Through Rules:

The game’s mechanics embody the critique: in order to “win” as McDonald’s, players must perpetuate the very behaviors the game seeks to expose as harmful. By forcing players to confront these trade-offs, the rules themselves serve as the argument, highlighting the systemic issues within global capitalism.

# Papers Please

In “Papers, Please” by Lucas Pope, procedural rhetoric drives the player’s experience by placing them as a border agent in the authoritarian state of Arstotzka. Players actively engage with a system of ever-changing rules, processing immigration documents under tight quotas while balancing their in-game family’s survival.

The game’s mechanics create moral dilemmas: players must decide whether to follow strict bureaucratic rules or act compassionately toward refugees and other applicants. These decisions highlight the dehumanizing nature of authoritarian systems, where survival often requires complicity. By forcing players to navigate these choices, “Papers, Please” demonstrates how bureaucracy erodes moral agency and thrives on systemic compliance, making its argument through interaction.
